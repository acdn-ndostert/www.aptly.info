Configuration
--------------

aptly looks for configuration file first in `~/.aptly.conf` then
in `/etc/aptly.conf` and, if no config file found, new one is created in
home directory. If `-config=` flag is specified, aptly would use config file at specified
location. Also aptly needs root directory for database, package and
published repository storage. If not specified, directory defaults to
`~/.aptly`, it will be created if missing.

Configuration files do not cascade. The file that gets loaded must contain all
configurations for a given aptly instance.

Configuration file is stored in JSON format (default values shown
below):

Options:

-   `rootDir` is root of directory storage to store database
    (`rootDir/db`), downloaded packages (`rootDir/pool`) and published
    repositories (`rootDir/public`)
-   `downloadConcurrency` is a number of parallel download threads to
    use when downloading packages
-   `downloadSpeedLimit` is a limit on download bandwidth used by aptly
    in kbytes per second, 0 means unlimited
-   `architectures` is a list of architectures to process; if left empty
    defaults to all available architectures; could be overridden with
    option `-architectures`
-   `dependencyFollowSuggests`: follow contents of `Suggests:` field
    when processing dependencies for the package
-   `dependencyFollowRecommends`: follow contents of `Recommends:` field
    when processing dependencies for the package
-   `dependencyFollowAllVariants`: when dependency looks like
    `package-a | package-b`, follow both variants always
-   `dependencyFollowSource`: follow dependency from binary package to
    source package
-   `dependencyVerboseResolve`:
    print detailed logs while resolving dependencies {{< version "1.1.0" >}}
-   `gpgDisableSign`: don't sign published repositories with `gpg`, also
    can be disabled on per-repo basis using `-skip-signing` flag when
    publishing
-   `gpgDisableVerify`: don't verify remote mirrors with `gpg`, also can
    be disabled on per-mirror basis using `-ignore-signatures` flag when
    creating and updating mirrors
-   `gpgProvider`: implementation of PGP signing/validation - `gpg` for external `gpg` utility or
    `internal` to use [Go internal implementation](/doc/feature/pgp-providers)
-   `downloadSourcePackages`: if enabled, all mirrors created would have
    flag set to download source packages; this setting could be
    controlled on per-mirror basis with `-with-sources` flag
-   `skipLegacyPool`: in aptly up to version 1.0.0,
    package files were stored in internal package pool
    with MD5-dervied path, since 1.1.0 package pool layout was changed;
    if option is enabled, aptly stops checking for legacy paths;
    by default option is enabled for new aptly installations and disabled when
    upgrading from older versions {{< version "1.1.0" >}}
-   `ppaDistributorID` & `ppaCodename` specifies parameters for short
    PPA url expansion, if left blank they default to output of
    `lsb_release` command
-   `FileSystemPublishEndpoints` is configuration of local filesystem
    publishing endpoints (see [custom filesystem publishing](/doc/feature/filesystem)) {{< version "1.1.0" >}}
-   `S3PublishEndpoints` is a configuration of Amazon S3 publishing
    endpoints (see [publishing to S3](/doc/feature/s3/))
-   `SwiftPublishEndpoints` describes OpenStack Swift publishing
    parameters (see [publishing to Swift](/doc/feature/swift))
-   `enableMetricsEndpoint` specifies whether the metrics endpoint should be enabled or disabled
    when running api serve (see [misc API](/doc/api/misc))
-   `logLevel` specifies the log level, valid values are `debug`, `info`, `warn` and
    `error`, only has full effect with log format set to `json`, it's recommended to leave at
    default value when log level is `default`
-   `logFormat` specifies the log format to use, can be `default` or `json`, when format is `json`
     all logs have a `time` key with timestamps in RFC3339 format and a `level` key with the log level
-   `serveInAPIMode` enables serving published repos according to configured `FileSystemPublishEndpoints` while running aptly in the api mode. If there are no `FileSystemPublishEndpoints`, it serves `public/` subdirectory of aptlyâ€™s root.

<div class="alert alert-warning alert-note"><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>rootDir</code> contains all the downloaded packages from remote
mirrors, so it should have enough space. For example. mirror of Debian
wheezy (amd64 and i386) requires 70 GiB of disk space.</div>

aptly would use HTTP proxy configured in `HTTP_PROXY` environment
variable.
